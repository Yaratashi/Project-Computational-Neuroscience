Cortical Development and Remapping through Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity

This project simulates a feedforward spiking neural network using Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) for synaptic weight adaptation. The network consists of input neurons feeding into network neurons with plastic synapses that update according to STDP rules.

-- Features:

Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Model

Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) for synaptic weight updates

Feedforward connectivity between input and network neurons

Correlated and uncorrelated input spike trains

Selective initial synaptic weights for specific neurons (81-120)

Visualization of final feedforward synaptic weights
