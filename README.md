Cortical Development and Remapping through Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity

This project simulates a feedforward spiking neural network using Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) for synaptic weight adaptation. The network consists of input neurons feeding into network neurons with plastic synapses that update according to STDP rules.
